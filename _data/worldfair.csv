Historical Note: This book was originally marked at 25 cents because it was the first all-color, all-new story superhero annual ever made. This comic also marked the first appearance of the Golden Age Sandman. In an article that Steve Gentner wrote regarding the Sandman, titled. ""Will the Real First Appearance of Sandman Please Stand Up?"" Gentner quotes National Editor Vin Sullivan, who said, ""Preparations for the publication began in 1938 when I approached an officer of the fair corporation whom I knew personally. Permission was obtained for the exclusive use of the World's Fair name on the proposed comic book. Following that, I made arrangements with DC Comics to produce the book utilizing features that were then appearing in its various magazines of which I was Editor. With a 25 cent price, the World's Fair Comics of 1939 was distributed and sold at the fair--when sales did not reach expectations, the price was reduced to 15 cents, and broader distribution was obtained via newsstands."" In addition to Sandman's debut, it marked the first appearance of new material for Superman (who appears blonde by mistake) outside of Action Comics Magazine. Sources: 1. Gentner, Steve.

The Superman at the World’s Fair Day celebration was an idea of publicist Duke Ducovny to help promote the World’s Fair Comics that DC (then called National) was publishing. At the event, children saw the first public appearance of Superman, Ray Middleton in costume. The event also featured a live radio broadcast of Superman’s radio show. The event was an incredible success, launching a wave of World’s Fair-themed comics and further boosting Superman’s popularity. Charles Atlas appeared at the fair, which was a highlight for Superman creator Joe Shuster, who appeared at the event.

Two different printings of the book were made, one with a then hefty price tag of 29 cents. The magazine features a cameo of publisher James Warren and appearances of Hanna-Barbera's other characters. The book was the only color comic book Warren printed. In order to publish the book, Warren won a licensing deal from the fair before the company had ever made a foray into the comics market. Warren used artists from Gold Key's talent pool, including Harvey Eisenberg, who helped develop the Flintstones as an animated series. Mel Crawford painted the cover, giving much more care and class than most other comic books produced at the time. Such a design and art technique for a regular twelve-cent cover would be considered by many as unreasonable. Crawford had done work with the characters before for Western's 1960 Little Golden Book, one of the first pieces of merchandise with the characters.                                                              source: Roach, David, and Jon B.

The fair played such a big part in the comic book publishing world that Centaur debuted a hero whose entire mission and backstory revolved around the World’s Fair. The Fantoman’s headquarters were right underneath the fairgrounds, where the character also lived. Don Markstein describes Fantom’s powers as follows: “He was stronger and better with his fists than most people, but he doesn’t seem to have extraordinary powers in that direction. He did display apparent mental powers, such as being able to hypnotize people against their will. No explanation was given.” After the fair ended, the publisher attempted to continue the series by dropping the fair from the character’s premise instead of calling him “Fantoman.” However, the character wouldn’t last much longer and would be dropped by Centaur in December 1940.

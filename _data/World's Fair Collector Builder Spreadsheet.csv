In 1940, Superman was king of the World’s Fair. The Superman at the World’s Fair Day celebration was an idea of publicist Duke Ducovny to help promote the World’s Fair Comics that DC (then called National) was publishing.  At the event, children say the first public appearance of Superman, Ray Middleton in costume. The event also featured a live radio broadcast of Superman’s radio show. The event was an incredible success that launched a wave of World’s Fair themed comics and also would even further boost Superman’s popularity.",

“During the 1964 World’s Fair, Milton Caniff was honored as part of an exhibit on comic art. The fair held a Steve Canyon Day honoring Caniff and his famous creation. The National Cartoonist Society was at the time being honored at the “Better Living Hall” in an exhibit titled “Comics Cavalcade.” Steve Canyon Day was the headlining programming day for this part of the fair. Dozens of cartoonists, including Rube Goldberg, Chester Gould, and Charles Schulz, all visited Steve Canyon Day to celebrate. Caniff was awarded two awards that day: a plaque from Major Gen. E.B. LeBailley of the Air Force in honor of Caniff’s dedication to space power and military support.   ",

The 1893 World Columbian Exposition played a big role on the history of comics. At this World’s Fair, The Chicago Inter-Ocean was showcasing its new highspeed newspaper press, the first in the world to use four-colors. During the fair, there were at least two 4-color sections per week and cartoons amongst the illustrations from the fair were almost always color cartoons. After the fair, cartoonist Charles Saalburg debuted the first color newspaper comic strip characters, the Ting-Lings. These characters predated Richard Felton Outcault’s The Yellow Kid by almost two years. 

(Thanks to historian Allan Holtz for these terrific notes).",

The fair played such a big part of the comic book publishing world that Centaur debuted a hero whose entire mission and backstory revolved around the World’s Fair.  The Fantoman’s headquarters were right underneath the fairgrounds, where the character also lived. 

Don Markstein describes the Fantom’s powers as so
“He was stronger and better with his fists than most people, but doesn't seem to have had extraordinary powers in that direction. He did display apparent mental powers, such as being able to hypnotize people against their will. No explanation was given.” 

After the fair ended, the publisher attempted to continue the series by dropping the fair from the character’s premise and instead just calling him “Fantoman.” However, the character wouldn’t last much longer and would be dropped by Centaur in December 1940.

While this comic features Buster Brown at the 1915 World’s Fair, the character made a name for himself at the 1904 fair. At the 1904 St. Louis fair, R.F. Outcault traveled to sell the character to different licenses, making the character arguably the most financially successful cartoon character up to that point. Among the licensees included the Brown shoe company, starting a partnership that would last for decades after the comic strip had already ended. ",
